##ALPHA BRANCH ANNOUNCEMENT
We've created an Alpha Branch for the Hypergrid OpenSource project. 

###MOTIVATION
   * Intended to be used by contributors and consumers for testing Features/Fixes prior to being merged to Master branch
   * An environment for Sprint cycle efforts to be merged into for viewing/consumption
   * Alleviate integration and regression issues resulting from development efforts (code commits)
   * Create a more systematic software development process
