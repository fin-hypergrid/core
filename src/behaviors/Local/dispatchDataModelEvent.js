/**
 * @summary Hypergrid data model event handler.
 * @desc This function is not called by Hypergrid.
 * Rather, it is handed to the data model (by {@link module:decorators.injectCode injectCode} as `dispatchEvent`) to issue callbacks to the grid.
 *
 * This handler:
 * 1. Checks the event string to make sure it conforms to the expected syntax:
 *    * Starts with `fin-hypergrid-data-` or `fin-hypergrid-schema-`
 *    * Includes only lowercase letters and hyphens
 * 2. Calls a handler in the {@link dataModelEventHandlers} namespace of the same name as the event string.
 * 3. Re-emits the event as a DOM event to the `<canvas>` element (unless the handler has already done so).
 *
 * The data model's `dispatchEvent` method is bound to the grid by {@link module:decorators.injectCode injectCode}.
 * A curried version of this function, bound to the grid instance, is either:
 * * Added to the data model via its `addListener` method, if it has one; or
 * * Force-injected into the data model, overriding any native implementation. (A native implementation may exist simply to "catch" calls that might be made before the data model is attached to Hypergrid.)
 *
 * @this {Hypergrid}
 * @param {string|NormalizedDataModelEvent} event
 * @memberOf module:decorators~
