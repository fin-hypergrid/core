 * Both the `addListener` polyfill as well as `datasaur-base`'s implementation service multiple listeners for the use case of multiple grid instances all using the same data model instance. To support this use case, your data model should service multiple listeners as well. (Doing so also lets the application add its own listener(s) to the data model.)

 *
 * If `addListener` is not implemented, Hypergrid falls back to a simpler approach, injecting its own implementation of `dispatchEvent`, bound to the grid instance, into the data model. If the data model already has such an implementation, the assumption is that it was injected by another grid instance using the same data model. The newly injected implementation will call the original injected implementation, thus creating a chain. This is an inferior approach because grids cannot easily unsubscribe themselves. Applications can remove all subscribers in the chain by deleting the implementation of `dispatchEvent` (the end of the chain) from the data model.

/**
 * @method DataModel#install
 * @summary Install methods into data model.
 * @desc _IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS METHOD IS OPTIONAL._
 * If your data model does not implement this method, {@link Local#resetDataModel} adds the default implementation from [polyfills.js](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core/tree/master/src/behaviors/Local/polyfills.js) and then uses it to install the other polyfills and fallbacks when no native implementations exist, thus ensuring there are implementations for Hypergrid to call.
 *
 * ### Catcher functions
 * Catcher functions catch calls made by Hypergrid to otherwise unimplemented functions so such calls fail silently rather than throw an error.
 * * When `api` is array: `install` injects catcher functions named for each string in the array.
 * * When `api` is an object: `install` injects catcher functions named for each key in the object. (Keys with non-function values are excluded.)
 *
 * Keys `constructor` and `initialize` are always excluded. In addition, the `install` method defined in `datasaur-base` will also exclude keys missing from whitelist (`api['!!keys']`) or included in blacklist (`api['!key']`).
 *
 * The type of _catcher function_ depends on the data model:
 * * Flat data model: Catcher functions are simple no-ops that fail silently.
 * * Stacked data model: Catcher functions forward calls down the stack to the first native implementation found. When no native implementation is found, the call then fails silently.
 *
 * ### Fallbacks methods
 * Instead of failing silently, Hypergrid can instead install fallback methods for missing implementations:
 *
 * When `options.inject` is truthy (and `api` is an object), `install` injects `api`'s fallback methods into the data model instead of simple catchers when no native implementation already exists (however see `options.force` below).
 *
 * For a stacked data model, the target for the injection is the bottom instance in the stack (the data source instance); and the forwarding mechanism is also installed so the call will find the fallback there.
 *
 * ### Forced installation
 * When `options.force` is truthy, the fallback methods are always installed regardless of whether or not a native implementation exists; _i.e.,_ the fallbacks override the native implementations.
 *
 * @param {object|string[]} api - Collection of methods or a list of method names.
 *
 * The following keys are however ignored:
 * * _When `api` is a hash:_
 *   * Keys defined as accessors (getters/setters)
 *   * Keys not defined as functions
 * * Keys named `initialize` or `constructor`
 * * Keys not named in `api['!!keys']` if defined (_i.e.,_ a whitelist)
 * * Keys named in `api['!keys']` if defined (_i.e.,_ a blacklist)
 *
 * @param {object} options
 * @param {boolean} [options.inject] - Injects `api` object's fallback methods for missing data model implementations. (Otherwise, just installs catchers based on the keys.)
 * @param {boolean} [options.force] - If `options.inject` also true, injects `api` object's fallback methods, even if data model already has an implementation.

/**
 * @method DataModel#toggleRow
 * @summary Mouse was clicked on a grid row.
 * @desc _IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS METHOD IS OPTIONAL._
 *
 * Hypergrid calls this method from one place, {@link Local#cellClicked behavior.cellClicked}, which is called from src/features/CellClick when user clicks on a tree or data cell.
 *
 * The data model may consume or ignore the click.
 *
 * If the data model consumes the click by modifying some data in the existing data set, it should dispatch the 'fin-hypergrid-data-loaded` data event to the grid, which causes a grid "repaint" (which re-renders rows and columns in place).
 *
 * If the data model consumes the click by transforming the data, it should dispatch the following data events to the grid:
 *    * 'fin-hypergrid-data-prereindex' before transforming the data
 *    * 'fin-hypergrid-data-postreindex' after transforming the data
 *
 * This causes Hypergrid to save the current row and/or column selections before and then attempt to restore them after, before a "shape change" (which recalculates row and column bounding rects and then re-renders them).
 *
 * "Transforming the data" means altering the data set (by adding/removing rows, _etc._). The typical use case for this is a click on a cell containing a drill-down control.
 *
 * After rerendering, Hypergrid dispatches a DOM event with the same _type_ (same event string) to the grid's `<canvas>` element for the benefit of any application listeners.
 *
 * #### Parameters:
 *
 * @param {number} rowIndex
 *
 * @param {number} [columnIndex] - For the drill-down control use case, implementations should call `this.isTreeCol(columnIndex)` if they want to restrict the response to clicks in the tree column (rather than any column). Although defined in Hypergrid's call, implementations should not depend on it, which may be useful for testing purposes.
 *
 * @param {boolean} [toggle] - One of:
 * * `undefined` (or omitted) - Toggle row.
 * * `true` - Expand row iff currently collapsed.
 * * `false` - Collapse row iff currently expanded.
 * > NOTE: Implementation of this parameter is optional. It may be useful for testing purposes but Hypergrid does not define actual parameter in its call in {@link Hypergrid#cellClicked}.
 *
 * @returns {boolean|undefined} If click was consumed by the data model:
 * * `undefined` Not consumed: Row had no drill-down control.
 * * `true` Consumed: Row had a drill-down control which was toggled.
 * * `false` Not consumed: Row had a drill-down control but it was already in requested state.
 * > NOTE: Implementation of a return value is optional as of version v3.0.0. It may be useful for testing purposes but {@link Hypergrid#cellClicked} no longer uses the return value (depending instead on the implementation dispatching data events), so implementations no longer need to support it. Therefore, in general, applications should no depend on a return value. For particular requirements, however, an applications may make a private contract with a data model implementation for a return value (that may or may not follow the above definition. Regardless of the implementation, the return value of this method is propagated through the return values of {@link Local#cellClicked} -> {@link Hypergrid#cellClicked} -> the application.

/**
 * @method DataModel#getCell
 * @summary Renderer configuration interceptor.
 * @desc _IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS METHOD IS OPTIONAL._
 * If your data model does not implement this method, {@link Local#resetDataModel} adds the default implementation ({@link module:hooks.getCell}).
 *
 * #### Description
 *
 * This method is a hook called on every cell just prior to rendering and is intended to be overridden.
 *
 * The first parameter to this method, `config`, Please refer to the {@link renderConfig} object for details. Most of the properties on this object can be overridden programmatically in this method. Properties typically overridden include {@link module:defaults.renderer renderer}, {@link module:defaults.editor editor}, {@link module:defaults.format format}, and the various permutations of {@link module:defaults.font font}, {@link module:defaults.color color}, and {@link module:defaults.halign halign}.
 *
 * Your override will be called with the data model as it's execution context (the `this` value).
 *
 * The only requirement for this method (or its override) is to return a reference to an instantiated cell renderer, which is all the default implementation does. This is typically the renderer whose name is in the {@link module:defaults.renderer config.renderer}, property (assumed to be a "registered" cell renderer). It doesn't have to be that cell renderer, however; and any object with a `paint` method will do.
 *
 * #### IMPORTANT CAVEAT!!
 *
 * Although this hook was designed to be overridden, adding lots (or any, really) programmatic logic to be executed on every cell, on every render, is _expensive_ in terms of performance, and doing so should only be a last resort.
 *
 * As Hypergrid has evolved, many properties have been added including row and cell properties, which can accomplish much that was previously impossible without overrideing `getCell`. For example, you can now select a formatter and a renderer simply by setting a column's (or row's) (or cell's) `format` or `renderer` property.
 *
 * Overriding `getCell` still has great facility when the rendering needs to be a function of the data values, but other than that, every effort should be made to avoid overriding `getCell` whenever possible.
 *
 * #### Parameters:
 * @param {CellEditor#renderConfig} config
 * @param {string} rendererName - Same as `config.renderer`, the proposed cell renderer name.
 * @returns {CellRenderer} An instantiated cell renderer.

/**
 * @method DataModel#getCellEditorAt
 * @summary Instantiate a new cell editor.
 * @desc _IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS METHOD IS OPTIONAL._
 * If your data model does not implement this method, {@link Local#resetDataModel} adds the default implementation ({@link module:hooks.getCellEditorAt}).
 *
 * #### Description
 *
 * The application developer may override this method to:
 * * Instantiate and return an arbitrary cell editor. The generic implementation here simply returns the declared cell editor. This is `undefined` when there was no such declaration, or if the named cell editor was not registered.
 * * Return `undefined` for no cell editor at all. The cell will not be editable.
 * * Set properties on the instance by passing them in the `options` object. These are applied to the new cell editor object after instantiation but before rendering.
 * * Manipulate the cell editor object (including its DOM elements) after rendering but before DOM insertion.
 *
 * Overriding this method with a null function (that always returns `undefined`) will have the effect of making all cells uneditable.
 *
 * The only requirement for this method (or its override) is to return a reference to an instantiated cell editor, which is all the default implementation does. This is typically the cell editor whose name is in the {@link module:defaults.editor config.editor} property (assumed to be a "registered" cell editor). It doesn't have to be that cell editor, however; any object conforming to the CellEditor interface will do.
 *
 * #### Parameters:
 *
 * @param {number} columnIndex - Absolute column index. I.e., the position of the column in the data source's original `fields` array, as echoed in `behavior.allColumns[]`.
 *
 * @param {number} rowIndex - Row index of the data row in the current list of rows, regardless of vertical scroll position, offset by the number of header rows (all the rows above the first data row including the filter row). I.e., after subtracting out the number of header rows, this is the position of the data row in the `index` array of the data source (i.e., the last data source pipeline).
 *
 * @param {string} editorName - The proposed cell editor name (from the render properties).
 *
 * @param {CellEvent} cellEvent - All enumerable properties of this object will be copied to the new cell editor object for two purposes:
 * * Used in cell editor logic.
 * * For access from the cell editor's HTML template (via mustache).
 *
 * Developer's override of this method may add custom properties, for the purposes listed above.
 *
 * Hypergrid adds the following properties, required by {@link CellEditor}:
 * * **`.format`** - The cell's `format` render prop (name of localizer to use to format the editor preload and parse the edited value). May be `undefined` (no formatting or parsing). Added by calling {@link Column#getCellEditorAt|getCellEditorAt} method. Developer's override is free to alter this property.
 * **`.column`** ({@link Column} object), the only enumerable property of the native `CellEvent` object. Read-only.
 *
