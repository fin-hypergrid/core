 * @classdesc This is a simple helper class to set up the tree-view data source in the context of a hypergrid.
 *
 * It includes methods to:
 * * Insert the tree-view data source (`DataSourceTreeview`) into the data model's pipeline (see {#@link TreeView#setPipeline|setPipeline} method) along with the optional filter and sort data sources.
 * * Perform the self-join and rebuild the index to turn the tree-view on or off, optionally hiding the ID columns ({#@link TreeView#setRelation|setRelation} method).
 *
 * @param {object} options - Passed to data source's {@link DataSourceTreeView#setRelation|setRelation} method ({@link http://openfin.github.io/hyper-analytics/DataSourceTreeview.html#setRelation|see}) when called here by local API's {@link TreeView#setRelation|this.setRelation} method.

    /**
     * @summary Reconfigure the data model's data pipeline for tree view.
     * @desc The _data transformation pipeline_ is an ordered list of data transformations, always beginning with an actual data source. Each _transformation_ in the pipeline operates on the data source immediately ahead of it. While transformations are free to completely rewrite the data in any way they want, most transformations merely apply an index to the data.
     *
     * The _shared pipeline_ is defined on the data model's prototype and is used for all grid instances (using the same data model). A grid can however define a _local pipeline_ on the data model's instance.
     *
     * In any case, the actual data pipeline is (re)constructed from a _pipeline configuration_ each time data is set on the grid via {@link dataModel/JSON#setData|setData}.
     *
     * This method reconfigures the data pipeline suitable for tree view. It is designed to operate on either of:
     * * the "shared" pipeline configuration (on the grid's data model's prototype)
     * * the grid's "local" pipeline configuration (on the grid's data model's instance)
     *
     * This method operates as follows:
     * 1. Reset the pipeline:
     *    * In the case of the shared pipeline, the array is truncated in place.
     *    * In the case of an instance pipeline, a new array is created.
     * 2. Add the first data source:
     *    * The data source provided in `options.firstPipe` is used if given; otherwise...
     *    * The existing pipeline configuration's first data source will be reused. (First time in, this will always come from the prototype's version.)
     * 3. Add the filter data source (if requested).
     * 4. Add the tree sorter data source (if requested).
     * 5. Finally, add the tree view data source.
     *
     * Step 1 above operates on the shared pipeline when you supply the data model's prototype in `options.dataModelPrototype` (see below). In this case, you have the option of calling this method _before_ instantiating your grid(s):
     *
     * ```javascript
     * var JSON = Hypergrid.dataModels.JSON.prototype;
     * var pipelineOptions = { dataModelPrototype: JSON.prototype }
     * TreeView.prototype.setPipeline(pipelineOptions);
     * ```
     *
     * This approach avoids the need to reset the data after reconfiguring the pipeline (in which case, do _not_ call this method again after instantiation).
     *
     * @param {object} [options]
     *
     * @param {boolean} [options.includeFilter=false] - Enables filtering. Includes the filter data source. The filter row is hidden if falsy.
     *
     * @param {boolean} [options.includeSorter=false] - Enables sorting. Includes the specialized tree sorter data source.
     *
     * @param {object} [options.dataModelPrototype] - Adds requested pipes to the "shared" pipeline array object instead of to a new custom (instance) pipeline array object.
     *
     * Supply this option when you want to set up the "shared" pipeline on the data model prototype, which would then be available to all grid instances subsequently created thereafter. In this case, you can call this method before or after grid instantiation. To call it before, call it directly on `TreeView.prototype`; to call it after, call it normally (on the `TreeView` instance).
     *
     * If omitted, a new "own" (instance) pipeline is created, overriding the prototype's (shared) pipeline. (In this case this method must be called normally, on the `Treeview` instance.)
     *
     * In either case, if called "normally" (on the instance), the data is reset via `setData`. (If called on the prototype it is not reset here. Currently the `Hypergrid` constructor calls it.)
     *
     * @param {dataSourcePipelineObject} [options.firstPipe] - Use as first data source in the new pipeline. If undefined, the existing pipeline's first data source will be reused.
