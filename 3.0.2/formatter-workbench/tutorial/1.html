<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
  This <em>workbench</em> is for learning about Hypergrid cell formatting using <em>localizers</em> and editing using <em>cell editors</em>.
</p>
<p>
  You can also use it for actual development and testing of such objects, cutting-and-pasting the final results to your own app.
</p>
<p>
  For your convenience, the app persists your work between sessions to <em>local storage</em> (which does not expire).
</p>

<h2>Interface</h2>
Before we begin the tutorial proper, let’s look at the interface, which consists of three main sections:
<ol>
  <li>A Tutorial pane with one tab and sometimes two tabs <em>(right)</em></li>
  <li>A live Hypergrid <em>(upper left)</em></li>
  <li>An Editor pane with five tabs <em>(lower left)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>
  Let's go over these one at a time.
</p>
<p>
  Click the <span class="button">&#x25ba;</span> button <em>(above)</em> to go to the next page.
