fix gp to copy all directories EXCEPT project dir
    copy all dirs first, delete project directory then build it

make all files pre - js - post html dynamically buildable
validate all js files


/poly-css
/poly-html
/poly-js

minimize all files before vulcanize
vulcanize ONLY 1X

describe my dev environment, dev loop and build
    aggresive valididation
    odd project structure
    vulcanizer doesn't compress any of the files
    also a better google pages export script

what is and why is polymer cool
    core/paper elements
    material design
    it supports themes
    what is webcomponents and why is it cool
        shadow-dom
            encapsulated dom and css(not really ;))
    single deployable html import file
    replace lotsa boilerplate
    angular-esque
        templates
        data binding
        pub/sub mechanism

fix yeoman build - move to gulp
plugin pattern

other components
    fin-hypergrid-dnd-list widget
    fin-rectangles
    fin-canvas

polymer has issues --  its young and evolving
    polyfills are really hard
        css piercing stuff is amazing that it works
    documentation is lacking or out of date often but you have the code

great touch-gesture library
    it's how I did the dnd list widget
    I need to use if for the hypergrid eventing

polymer needs a dependency-injection component

---------------------------------------------
goals for the hypergrid

    look and behave great
        -end users should confuse it with excel, it really needs to look professional, not like a toy
    super easy to use
        -I don't want to jump through hoops to see my data in it, I shouldn't have to build some crazy dom representation of my data


    lightweight
        -use as little memory and cpu as possible
    native widget feel
        -coming from other programming languages ui should behave like a java table or .net grid


    no deferred rendering/instant rendering
        -data is scrolled through and instantly visible, no blank screen waiting for data
    good general purpose html5 grid but the best for finance/big data
        -important features are data manipulation
        -sorting, filtering, aggretations, rollups, pivoting


    easy to integrate with your data
        -json based data manipulation, MEAN stack
    allow for easy virtualization
        -one of my biggest peeves from java/smalltalk days
        -design should accomodate external data manipulation analytics


    use html5/javascript best practices
        -difficult due to constantly shifting landscape
        -3x start over, browserify, wc, polymer
        -dev loop validation/build every save
    opensource
        -participate in open culture, community supported

    initial features to be driven by existing html5 popular grid components

what is Polymer

    project by google
        -started about 2 years ago
        -provides the ONLY polyfil for webcomponents
    built on top of the web components standard
        -encapsulated customizable interoperable components

    webcomponents polyfill
        -chrome suppports webcomponents the most natively
        -get other browsers compliant early
    best practices convenience framework for building webcomponents
        -make it easier to build your own components

    material design compliant responsive design widget set
        -paper-elements
        -core-elements

    https://www.polymer-project.org/tools/designer/
        -designer - they even have a visual painter

    you don't need polymer to use hypergrid
        -you need web components support, native or polyfill
        -openfin thinks the future is polymer that's why we chose it for the implementation
        -if you choose to use the whole polymer stack theres all this cool stuff

-------------------------------------
some hypergrid features;  the "pink" demo

    unlimited row count
        -quadrillion virtual row example
        -q million sortable row, billion non-sortable row

    currently minimal data management/sorting/editing/grouping
        -planned is a data management internal piece (in JS process)
        -already looked at alternate faster sorting of columns
            -we may have Openfin only enhancements to allow for very fast data manipulation here
        -exernal (in q initially) capability

    column resize/reordering
        -a little buggy at the moment, it's new
        -row resize/reordering is comming

    easy custom cell rendering
        -create your own custom renderers, there's lotsa of examples and source code to look at
        -be carefull, it's easy to hang yourself here in terms of performance

    full multiselect semantics
        -shift/control ammending of selection
        -undo support coming

    non-linear auto scrolling speed to accomodate large data sets
        -auto scrolling accelerates only vertically at the moment
        -will be reasonable to scroll and find a specific row in an enormous table
            -page up/down
            -single row up/down
            -hover on the scrollbar to show index(index might not be a fixed column)

    single file deployment of the grid
        -polymer project vulcanize provides single webcomponent import
        -scans through your component and all dependencies and creates a single htmlfile
        -still need to minimize your own javascript
        -grid is just a custom web component tag

    json support
        -json behavior
        -very simple to provide initial dataset and update it

    easy augmentation via polymer plugin pattern
        -create webcomponent with function 'installOn(hypergrid)' function, and make it a subtag of the hypergrid tag
        -can programmatically ammend the hypergrid or its subcomponents

    gesture control through polymer-gestures
        -touch/tap events support
        -its a little quirky on phones at the moment, will be fixed

    excel integration
        -only within openfin container, it uses the inter-app bus
        -uses excel dna in conjunction with openfin excel adapter

    interface to Q
        -sorttable.q and bigtable.q provided as examples
        -Q analytics coming
        -other external interfaces coming.....
        -any JSON source can be added very quickly

    cut/copy/paste support
        -only copy support at the moment///////9

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

quick hypergrid design

    fin-hypergrid
        polymer component
            -use the coming standard web component
        entrypoint for the grid
            -single file custom tag import

    fin-canvas
        wrapped up html5 canvas
            -there were several smaller resuable "libraries", this is one
            -the drawing surface and graphics context
            -traditional composite pattern based gui system
            -generate nicer events conducive to grid
        uses the fin-rectangles project for simple rectangle/point functionality

    fin-rectangles
        provides common rectangle and point objects and functions
            -reusable polymer element

    fin-vampire-bar
        only 33million pixes to scroll with native scrollbars
            -hypergrid uses custom scrollbars
            -edward tufte calls them content-vampires ,8-12% of the screen real-estate

    fin-hypergrid-behavior
        think of as a tablemodel++
            -has the datamodel + feature chain of responsibility for event handling
            -feature chain to handle events
            -features may have state or manipulate state found on the hypergrid
        place to park code that is different for virtualization

    fin-hypergrid-renderer
        paint function using context from canvas
            -implements the main paint function (entry point) given a graphics context
        has the rows X columns iteration logic
            -has all the logic for iterating cells and rendering the grid
            -caches various values values for arbitrary querying after a rendering
            -should query hypergrid for values/hypergrid my delegate to behavior

    fin-hypergrid-cell-renderer
        stored in cell provider
            -maintained in a lookup cache on the cell-provider
        easy to register
            -create any kind of cell rendering you want, it's very easy
        implements paint(graphicsContext)
            -be carefull here as you could hose the renderering performance
            -sparklines are implemented here
            -see json example

    fin-hypergrid-cell-provider
        holds the cache of cell-renderers
            -has 3 important functions getCell, getFixedCollCell, getFixedRowCell
        behavior is the cell-provider factory
            -easy to configure your own cell provider per behavior

    fin-hypergrid-cell-editor
        stored in hypergrid
            -probably move to cell-provider
        selected by behavior
            -easy to add more

    fin-hypergrid-feature
        linked list on behavior
        chain of responisibility
            -handles input events from hypergrid
            -alters data on itself or the hypergrid

    fin-hypergrid-selection-model
        rectangle based selection management
            -uses fin-rectangle project
        allows for arbitrary large rectangular selections
            -renderes extremely fast

    plugins
        installOn(hypergrid) function must be implemented by plugin
        nest tags inside fin-hypergrid
            -excel
            -how you provide the behavior
        two places to load plugins
            -hypergrid developers -> fin-hypergrid.pre.html <fin-plugins>
            -application developers -> <fin-hypergrid>
            -see demo.html
            -how alot of the hypergrid behavior is implemented
            -cell-editors
        refactor for more hypergrid functionality


techniques (things we learned)
    common sense
        -learn the profiling tools
        -there are some neat ones in chrome developer tools
    used in grid controls in other languages
        -much can be learned from how grids are implemented in other languages/libraries

    avoid dom manipulation
        -all canvas hand coded rendering (duh)
    row/column based scrolling
        -not pixel,custom scrollbars,unlimited virtual rows

    good book "HTML5 game developement insights"
        -fin-canvas requestAnimationFrame to control the fps
        -double buffering
        -damage rectangles
    talking to graphicsContext is expensive
        -precedence order of time consumption
        -see fin-hypergrid-cell-provider.defaultCellPaint
        -don't clip cells, paint in order to cover overflow
        -use extra dom for css animations

    rectangle based selection model
        -accomodate large selection areas
        -fast selection testing per cell
    stable sorting for sort accumulation
        -accumulate sorts (nested sorts)

    polymer plugin pattern
        -great way to achieve composition
    use requestAnimationFrame
        -smooth animations
        -don't have anything take longer than ~17ms
        -use the chrome developer tools here

    know about device pixel density and the backing store
        -devicePixelDensity manipulation for sharper grid
        -really looks better on super dense displays like retina
        -can cause a slowdown
        -is optional attribute on fin-hypergrid 'hidpi'
        -can be programmatically turned on/off
    only iterate/render what is visible
        -common sense


gotchas
    polymer inheritance issues
        -override of superclass functions doesn't seem to work yet (maybe it does now)
        -always an issue when on the bleeding edge
    specific graphics context operations are expensive
        -text measuring
        -border rendering
        -checking/changing the font
    dom access can be expensive
        -do batch operations when possible
        -"the dom isnt slow you are"

process and best practices
    environment was tricky
        -cutting edge
    restarted three times
        -browserify > webcomponents > polymer
    polymer
        -odd but necessary extra nested directory
        -.bowerrc
        -modified as necessary

    grunt based
        -maybe switch to gulp
    livereload
        -really nice feature in javascript/web devlopement
        -tricky to get working right with polymer

    vulcanize
        -best way to deploy the final component
    wct-testing
        -polymer group created their own testing harness

    aggresive validation
        -css, html, js validation plus concat
    polymer-solutions
        -core component page - see index.html multiple files - not documented
        -github pages live demo
        -id like to move to gulp

    yeoman generator for polymer
        -maybe the polymer one is better, it wasn't working when I started
    my yeoman generator
        -https://github.com/stevewirts/generator-fin-polymer
