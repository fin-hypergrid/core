about me

---------------------------------------------
goals for the hypergrid

-look and behave great

-super easy to use

-lightweight

-native widget feel

-no deferred rendering/instant rendering

-best general purpose html5 grid available

-easy to integrate with your data

-allow for easy virtualization

-use html5/javascript best practices

-opensource

-initial features to be driven by existing html5 popular grid components

-------------------------------------
what is Polymer

-project by google

-built on top of the web components standard

-webcomponents polyfill

-best practices convenience framework for building webcomponents

-material design compliant responsive design widget set

-------------------------------------
some hypergrid features;  the "pink" demo

-unlimited row count

-currently minimal data management/sorting/editing/grouping

-column resize/reordering

-easy custom cell rendering

-full multiselect semantics

-non-linear auto scrolling speed to accomodate large data sets

-json support

-single file deployment of the grid

-easy augmentation via polymer plugin pattern

-gesture control through polymer-gestures

-excel integration

-interface to Q

-cut/copy/paste support

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
quick hypergrid design

* fin-hypergrid
-polymer component
-entrypoint for the grid

* fin-canvas
-wrapped up html5 canvas
-uses the fin-rectangles project for simple rectangle/point functionality

* fin-hypergrid-behavior
-think of as a tablemodel++
-place to park code that is different for virtualization

* fin-rectangles
-provides common rectangle and point objects and functions

* fin-hypergrid-renderer
-paint function using context from canvas
-has the rows X columns iteration logic

* fin-hypergrid-cell-renderer
-stored in cell provider
-easy to register
-implements paint(graphicsContext)

* fin-hypergrid-cell-provider
-holds the cache of cell-renderers
-behavior is the cell-provider factory

* fin-hypergrid-cell-editor
-stored in hypergrid
-selected by behavior


* fin-hypergrid-feature
-linked list on behavior
-chain of responisibility


* fin-hypergrid-selection-model
-rectangle based selection management
-allows for arbitrary large rectangular selections

* fin-vampire-bar
-only 33million pixes to scroll with native scrollbars

* plugins
-installOn(hypergrid) function must be implemented by plugin
-nest tags inside fin-hypergrid
-two places to load plugins
-refactor for more hypergrid functionality

-------------------------------------------------
techniques (things we learned)

-common sense

-used in grid controls in other languages

-avoid dom manipulation

-row/column based scrolling

-good book "HTML5 game developement insights"

-talking to graphicsContext is expensive

-rectangle based selection model

-stable sorting for sort accumulation

-polymer plugin pattern

-use requestAnimationFrame

-know about device pixel density and the backing store

-only iterate/render what is visible

------------------------------------------------------------
gotchas

-polymer inheritance issues

-specific graphics context operations are expensive

-dom access can be expensive

-------------------------------------------------------------
process and best practices

-environment was tricky

-restarted three times

-polymer

-grunt based

-livereload

-vulcanize

-wct-testing

-aggresive validation

-polymer-solutions

-yeoman generator for polymer

-my yeoman generator
