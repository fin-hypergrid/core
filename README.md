[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openfin/fin-hypergrid.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/openfin/fin-hypergrid)

**fin-hypergrid** is an ultra-fast HTML5 grid presentation layer, achieving its speed by rendering (in a canvas tag) only the currently visible portion of your (virtual) grid, thus avoiding the latency and life-cycle issues of building, walking, and maintaining a complex DOM structure. Please be sure to checkout our [design overview](OVERVIEW.md)

Below is an example custom application built on top of the Hypergrid API tooling.
It also highlights a DOM-based custom external editor triggered via hypergrid events as well as interaction with Hypergrid's column ordering API
