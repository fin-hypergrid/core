**HYPERGRID DEVELOPERS PLEASE READ:** Hypergrid has a new home! Please review the [_Transition Notes_](TRANSITION-NOTES.md) carefully.

**fin-hypergrid** is an ultra-fast HTML5 grid presentation layer, achieving its speed by rendering (in a canvas tag) only the currently visible portion of your (virtual) grid, thus avoiding the latency and life-cycle issues of building, walking, and maintaining a complex DOM structure. Please be sure to checkout our [design overview](OVERVIEW.md) 

Below is an example custom application built ontop of the Hypergrid API tooling. It also highlights a DOM based custom external editor triggered via hypergrid events as well as interaction with Hypergrid's column ordering API

### Current Release (2.0.2 - 4 June 2017)

2.0 reflects a substantial simplification of the core functionality of the grid to just customized rendering. The rendering engine does allow support for showing sorting, filtering, grouping, etc. but specific logic on how a user may want to do that is not apart for this project. Demos will be made available on the [wiki](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core/wiki) for this.

2.0 also replaces the 2015-2016 [prototype version](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core/tree/polymer-prototype), which was built around Polymer. It is now completely "de-polymerized" and is being made available as:
* An [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fin-hypergrid) for use with browserify.
* A single JavaScript file [fin-hypergrid.js](https://fin-hypergrid.github.io/core/build/fin-hypergrid.js) you can reference in a `<script>` tag.

_For a complete list of changes, see the [release notes](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core/releases)._

### Developer Documentation

Primarily our tutorials will be on the [wiki](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core/wiki). 

We are also maintaining [online API documentation](https://fin-hypergrid.github.io/core/doc/Hypergrid.html) for all public objects and modules. This documentation is necessarily a on-going work-in-progress.

(Cell editor information can be found [here](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core/wiki/Cell-Editors).)

(Cell Rendering information can be found [here](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core/wiki/Cell-Renderers).)

Hypergrid global configurations can be found [here](https://fin-hypergrid.github.io/core/doc/module-defaults.html).
