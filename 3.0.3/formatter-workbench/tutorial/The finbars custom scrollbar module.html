<h3>The <code>finbars</code> custom scrollbar module</h3>

<p>Hypergrid uses custom scrollbars (<a target="npm" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/finbars">finbars</a>) which can be fully styled and which are not subject to limitations of the various browsers’ coordinate systems.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>The Hypergrid scrollbars (“finbars”) are simple HTML, styled with CSS:</p>

<pre><span class="tag">div class="finbar-horizontal"</span><span class="tag">div class="thumb"</span><span class="close-tag">div</span><span class="close-tag">div</span>
<span class="tag">div class="finbar-vertical"</span><span class="tag">div class="thumb"</span><span class="close-tag">div</span><span class="close-tag">div</span></pre>

<img src="img/trackpad-scrollbars-circa-2015.png" style="float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:.3em">

<h3 style="margin-top:0">Default scrollbar style</h3>
<p>
  The default stylesheet for the scrollbars
  (<a target="github" href="https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/finbars/blob/master/src/finbars.css">finbars.css</a>, automatically injected into the DOM by the <code>Finbar</code> constructor) mimics the <span class="macOS"></span> trackpad system scrollbars, c. 2015, which looked something like the screenshot at right:</p>

<p>
  <strong>Scrollbar positioning:</strong>
  The scrollbars are superimposed over the content, near the edges.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Gutter style:</strong>
  The scrollbars’ gutters are completely hidden; just their <em>thumbs</em> are visible.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Thumb style:</strong>
  The thumbs are capsule shaped and filled with a light grey color. This color works well enough over this photo. Over a white background they are much harder to see (even with their slightly darker borders).
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Thumb opacity:</strong>
  The vertical scrollbar thumb is shown at 40% opacity (<i>i.e.,</i> translucent), further reducing its brightness, making it even harder to see. The horizontal scrollbar thumb is shown here at 100% opacity only because the mouse was hovering over it when the screenshot was taken (the mouse pointer was not captured in the screenshot).
</p>

<h3><span class="macOS"></span> has moved on</h3>

<p>Apple has since improved on their system scrollbar style, while the default <code>finbars</code> stylesheet has remained a fossil from 2015.</p>

<p>The following observations are of <span class="macOS"></span> 10.13 (High Sierra):</p>

<p><span class="macOS"></span> trackpad scrollbars, c. 2018:</p>
<table style="margin-left:1.5em"><tr style="vertical-align:top">
  <td><img src="img/trackpad-scrollbars.png" height="100" width="100"></td>
  <td><ul style="margin-top:0">
     <li style="margin-top:0">The capsule’s fill and stroke colors are now reversed: The fill is now dark grey and the edge is now light, which seems to work better over a wider variety of content</li>
    <li>The scrollbars are now hidden until the user tries to scroll (using a two-finger drag on the trackpad)</li>
  </ul></td>
</tr></table>

<p><span class="macOS"></span> mouse scrollbars, c. 2018 (<i>i.e.,</i> when a mouse is plugged into the Mac):</p>
<table style="margin-left:1.5em"><tr style="vertical-align:top">
  <td><img src="img/mouse-scrollbars.png" height="100" width="100"></td>
  <td><ul style="margin-top:0">
    <li style="margin-top:0">The gutters are now shown all the time</li>
    <li>The the content area is reduced to accommodate the scrollbars</li>
    <li>The thumbs are now wider</li>
  </ul></td>
</tr></table>
